# covid-api
COVID19 Api based on Johns Hopkins CSSE data

The intend of this project is to create an API (possibly in **Python**) which will make easier to access the COVID19 reports provided by the Johns Hopkins CSSE: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

# Status

We are in the early phase of the project and framework, architectural and other decisions haven't been taken yet. Please help discussing them in the GitHub **Issues** section of this project.
